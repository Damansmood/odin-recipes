Apply my recently learned HTML, GitHub, and Git skills

This is my brief introduction before beginning the project. As far as I know, I am making a basic recipe website. This will primarily be using HTML, Git, and GitHub skills that I have learned thus far. Later on, I will return to this project and apply CSS and eventually JavaScript skills as well. After I have completed all the tasks, I will return here and reflect on what I learned, what was easy, what was difficult, and what I would do differently next time. As of right now, I managed to set up a GitHub repository and clone it onto my local computer, create a README file (this one) after the fact since I didn't select that option when setting up the repository, all without referring to any notes. I am pleased with this so far, even if it is extremely basic.

Reflection after finishing HTML section:
    That was actually pretty easy. Almost felt like review from middle school from whatever our inro to computer class was. That was fun and it was satisfying seeing it come together, and I didn't use my notes much at all. Straightforward. Only thing I was still wrapping my head around was pushing to GitHub correctly and remembering to add and commit before pushing. Onto CSS now - I'm excited to get to the good stuff (aka interactivity with JavaScript)!

Finished CSS updates to the page. Made some basic updates, just toying around with some features learned in the course.
