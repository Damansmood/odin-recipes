        Who doesn't like a good sandwich or sub? It's the stereotypical lunch food. <em>Hey Timmy, what'ya having for lunch? A sandwich</em>. But next time Timmy gets asked about his lunch, it won't be just any sandwich. It'll be this <strong>hunk of meat slabbed between some toasted baked delicacy</strong>.

        This sub is made from pretty simple ingredients. The tuna can be found at any grocery store, already seasoned to your liking. All of the components can be bought and there is minimal preparation time involved. That's why we love this recipe!
