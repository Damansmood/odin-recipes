        Who's ever said no to <strong>breakfast for dinner</strong>? Or lunch? Or any meal, for that matter? Breakfast foods hold a special place in our hearts because there's just something that hits different about eating a meal that you're supposed to eat in the morning - at any time of day. And the <strong>king of those breakfast foods is none other than the classic itself, pancakes</strong>. But these pancakes come with a twist - they have enough <strong>protein</strong> to replace that nasty post-workout double chocolate shake from Optimum Nutrition! Toss that artifical powder out and try these instead! (<em>Actually, don't toss out the protein powder - they're crucial for this recipe unfortunately. But you won't taste the the lackluster powder, so don't worry!</em>)

        The recipe itself is pretty straightforward. Think about how you make your regular pancakes. <em>Flour, eggs, maybe a little vanilla extract, some sugar, top it off with water or milk,</em>, whisk it all up and pour that oil on the pan get right to it. These are similar in nature, but the preparation is just slightly different. Firstly, we'll be using <strong>protein powder</strong> in place of flour. So pick your favorite flavor (we opt for chocolate in this case), throw in the egg, and maybe even a mashed up banana if you're up for it! Finally, a pinch of sugar and vanilla extract, and opt for milk instead of water, and we're good to go. <strong>Let's get cooking!</strong>
