Apply my recently learned HTML, GitHub, and Git skills

This is my brief introduction before beginning the project. As far as I know, I am making a basic recipe website. This will primarily be using HTML, Git, and GitHub skills that I have learned thus far. Later on, I will return to this project and apply CSS and eventually JavaScript skills as well. After I have completed all the tasks, I will return here and reflect on what I learned, what was easy, what was difficult, and what I would do differently next time. As of right now, I managed to set up a GitHub repository and clone it onto my local computer, create a README file (this one) after the fact since I didn't select that option when setting up the repository, all without referring to any notes. I am pleased with this so far, even if it is extremely basic.
